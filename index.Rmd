# Introduction

Welcome to the course **Quantitative methods and Statistics (IDR4000)**. The course aims to give students an overview of methodological aspects within the field of sport and exercise-physiology. Specifically, planning, conducting and analyzing research projects with human participants will be covered. These course notes covers *almost* the entire course through the combination of video lectures, tutorials and references to the course literature and external resources.

## Practical information

### Learning objectives
Learning objectives can be read in Norwegian [here](https://www.inn.no/content/view/full/163709/language/nor-NO).

### Learning strategies
The course will include lectures, laboratory exercises, computer exercises, seminars and student presentations. Lectures will be held on-line (zoom), as pre-recorded in this book and in-person on campus. Due to the current pandemic, you are required to do laboratory exercises in your cohort. 
Computer exercises require that you have special computer software installed on your computer. The software is free (see specific chapters in these course notes).

Assignments will be presented in this text with information on how to hand them in. The whole course is evaluated based on a portfolio (see below).

### Course evaluation
As a student you can contribute to the quality of the course by engaging in course evaluation throughout the course. You will be asked to answer a pre-course questionnaire about your *expectations* and a post-course questionnaire about your *experiences*. You are also welcomed to take part in systematic discussions during the course about the quality of teaching and course material. With these notes I want to underline the importance of student participation in the continuous development of the course (and program) teaching/learning qualities.


### Lecturers and course administration

In order of appearance 

- Daniel Hammarström (daniel.hammarstrom@inn.no), is responsible for course administration and will be teaching statistics and molecular methods.
- Kristian Lian, Ingvill Odden and Lars Nymoen will act as teacher assistants in organizing methods in the physiology lab.
- Stein Olaf Olsen will act as a teacher assistant in the molecular lab.
- Prof. Carten Lundby will cover aspects CO<sub>2</sub> re-breathing techniques (physiology).
- Prof. Finnur Dellsén will cover philosophy of science. 
- Prof. Stian Ellefsen will teach molecular methods. 

### Updates, notifications and general communication

These course notes **will be** updated during the course. General information and last minute changes will be posted on Canvas, make sure to check it as part of your daily study routine. 



### Literature
A full list of recommended literature can be found [here](https://www.inn.no/pensum). Literature will be referenced in specific sections in these course notes.

### Grades
The course is graded pass/fail.

### Language 
My (Daniel) first language is Swedish, I'm sure most of you will understand what I'm talking about. However, due to the fact that we accept international students to the program, most written communication and some lectures will be in English. You are not expected to write in English, it is however possible!


## Assignments and Portfolio exam

The course is based on several assignments. Some of these assignments are to be handed in as part of a portfolio exam upon which your grade is based. 

Assignments that are due during the course (arbeidskrav) are expected to be further improved after feedback from fellow students and teachers before inclusion in your portfolio.

The table below shows all assignments that are part of the course. Some are not to be included in the portfolio and some assignments are group assignments (see Table).
