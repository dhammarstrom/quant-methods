The course aims to give students an overview of methodological aspects within the field of sport and exercise-physiology. Specifically, planning, conducting and analyzing research projects with human participants will be covered. These course notes covers almost the entire course through the combination of video lectures, tutorials and references to the course literature and external resources. INTRO VIDEO LECTURE 0.1 Practical information 0.1.1 Learning strategies The course will include lectures, laboratory exercises, computer exercises, seminars and student presentations. Lectures will be held on-line (zoom), pre-recorded in this book and in-person on campus. Due to the current pandemic, you are required to do laboratory exercises in your cohort. Computer exercises require that you have special computer software installed on your computer. The software is free (see specific chapters in these course notes). Assignments will be presented in this text with information on how to hand them in. The whole course is evaluated based on a portfolio (see below). 0.1.2 Lecturers and course administration In order of appearance Daniel Hammarström (daniel.hammarstrom@inn.no), is responsible for course administration and will be teaching statistics and molecular methods. Prof. Carten Lundby will cover aspects CO2 re-breathing techniques (physiology). Prof. Finnur Dellsén will cover philosophy of science. Prof. Stian Ellefsen will teach molecular methods. 0.1.3 Updates, notifications and general communication These course notes will be updated during the course. General information and last minute changes will be posted on Canvas, make sure to check it as part of your daily study routine. 0.1.4 Learning objectives Assignments are described in detail below. Learning objectives can be read in Norwegian here. 0.1.5 Literature A full list of recommended literature can be found here. Literature will be referenced in specific sections in these course notes. 0.1.6 Grades The course is graded pass/fail. 0.1.7 Language My (Daniel) first language is Swedish, Im sure most of you will understand what Im talking about. However, due to the fact that we accept international students to the program, most written communication and some lectures will be in English. You are not expected to write in English, it is however possible! 0.2 Assignments and Portfolio exam The course is based on several assignments. Some of these assignments are to be handed in as part of a portfolio exam upon which your grade is based. Assignments that are due during the course (arbeidskrav) are expected to be further improved after feedback from fellow students and teachers before inclusion in your portfolio. The table below shows all assignments that are part of the course. Some are not to be included in the portfolio and some assignments are group assignments (see Table). Assignment Due date Included in portfolio Group assignment Descriptive statistics, reliability and validity 2021-09-10 Yes Yes Study designs 2021-10-01 Yes No Extraction and analysis of DNA 2021-10-15 Optionala Yes Extraction of RNA and analysis of qPCR experiments 2021-10- Optionala Yes Extraction and analysis of Protein 2021-10- Optionala Yes Regression models and prediction from data 2021-10- No Yes Drawing inference from statistical models 2021-10- No Yes Statistical power and sample size calculations 2021-11- Yes Yes Analyzing repeated measures experiments 2021-11- Yes No Philosophy of scienceb 2021-11- Yes No a Select one laboratory assignments for your portfolio exam. b This assignment is presented in connection with lectures. In addition to arbeidskrav/assignments, smaller assignments and quizzes are presented in this book, but you are not required to do them to pass the course. 0.3 Other information "],["introduction-to-data-science.html", "1 Introduction to data science 1.1 About data in the world of sport and exercise 1.2 Tools in data science 1.3 Reproducability 1.4 Storing data in spreadsheets", " 1 Introduction to data science 1.1 About data in the world of sport and exercise Data is everywhere. Most of us walk around with a data collection device in our pockets all the time. This device (your mobile phone), records and store data about you all throughout the day. Such data are the basis of the quantified self movement1 that have grown in popularity as capabilities to record data from daily life has become better. People interested in quantifying their personal life does so for different reasons, but often with the intent to improve their health2. Much of these kind of data are readily available to us due to the fact we are protected by data privacy policies and regarded as personal data3. With some effort you yourself can get your data out of your iphone to explore, for example, your daily step count. I discovered that my phone(s) has been collecting data for me since 2016 and I tend to walk less steps on Sundays compared to Saturdays (see Figure 1.1). Figure 1.1: Step count data from my iPhone displayed as all avalable data points (A, after data cleaning) and average step per weekday, per year and season (B). Data are also collected and stored in publicly available databases. Such databases are created for the purpose to store specific types of data, such as soccer4 or biathlon results5, or biological information such as gene sequences6. Even data from scientific studies are now days often publicly available7 meaning that we can perform scientific studies on unique data sets without collecting the data ourselves. The above examples shows that there are abundance of data around and available to us. The problem is that it is hard understand all this data. This is where data science and data literacy comes in. In the world of sport and exercise, regardless if you are interested in doing scientific investigations, coach a soccer-team or individual athletes or help patients recover from surgery using exercise therapy, you are faced with the problem of handling and make sense of data. Some of the key skills and deeper understanding about data science are very much transferable between such areas of practice. Think about the literature! Spiegelhalter (The Art of Statistics, in the introduction chapter) talks about how statistics has evolved towards the broader field of data science. In data science, statistical theory and methods are just parts of the problem solving cycle. Try to think about how you would use the PPDAC cycle as a exercise coach and a scientist. What are the similarities and differences? One broader aim of this course is for you to develop skills to better understand data. 1.2 Tools in data science 1.3 Reproducability 1.4 Storing data in spreadsheets Read more about the quantified self movement in this Wikipedia article See this website for intriguing examples See e.g. Apples Privacy Policy. understat.com stores match specific data from major leagues. Data are available through software packages such as worldfootballR biathlonresults.com/ hosts results from the international biathlon federation. An example of analyzed data can be seen here. Ensembl and the National center for biotechnology information are commonly used databases in the biomedical sciences. We published our raw data together with a recent paper (Mølmen et al 2021 doi: 10.1186/s12967-021-02969-1.) together with code to analyze it in a public repository.
