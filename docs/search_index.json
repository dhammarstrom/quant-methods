The course aims to give students an overview of methodological aspects within the field of sport and exercise-physiology. Specifically, planning, conducting and analyzing research projects with human participants will be covered. These course notes covers almost the entire course through the combination of video lectures, tutorials and references to the course literature and external resources. 1.1 Quick links: Study questions 1.2 Practical information 1.2.1 Learning objectives Learning objectives can be read in Norwegian here. 1.2.2 Learning strategies The course will include lectures, laboratory exercises, computer exercises, seminars and student presentations. Lectures will be held on-line (zoom), as pre-recorded in this book and in-person on campus. Due to the current pandemic, you are required to do laboratory exercises in your cohort. Computer exercises require that you have special computer software installed on your computer. The software is free (see specific chapters in these course notes). Assignments will be presented in this text with information on how to hand them in. The whole course is evaluated based on a portfolio (see below). 1.2.3 Course evaluation As a student you can contribute to the quality of the course by engaging in course evaluation throughout the course. You will be asked to answer a pre-course questionnaire about your expectations and a post-course questionnaire about your experiences. You are also welcomed to take part in systematic discussions during the course about the quality of teaching and course material. With these notes I want to underline the importance of student participation in the continuous development of the course (and program) teaching/learning qualities. 1.2.4 Lecturers and course administration In order of appearance Daniel Hammarström (daniel.hammarstrom@inn.no), is responsible for course administration and will be teaching statistics and molecular methods. Kristian Lian, Ingvill Odden and Lars Nymoen will act as teacher assistants in organizing methods in the physiology lab. Stein Olaf Olsen will act as a teacher assistant in the molecular lab. Prof. Carten Lundby will cover aspects CO2 re-breathing techniques (physiology). Prof. Finnur Dellsén will cover philosophy of science. Prof. Stian Ellefsen will teach molecular methods. 1.2.5 Updates, notifications and general communication These course notes will be updated during the course. General information and last minute changes will be posted on Canvas, make sure to check it as part of your daily study routine. 1.2.6 Literature A full list of recommended literature can be found here. Literature will be referenced in specific sections in these course notes. 1.2.7 Grades The course is graded pass/fail. 1.2.8 Language My (Daniel) first language is Swedish, Im sure most of you will understand what Im talking about. However, due to the fact that we accept international students to the program, most written communication and some lectures will be in English. You are not expected to write in English, it is however possible! 1.3 Assignments and Portfolio exam The course is based on several assignments. Some of these assignments are to be handed in as part of a portfolio exam upon which your grade is based. Assignments that are due during the course (arbeidskrav) are expected to be further improved after feedback from fellow students and teachers before inclusion in your portfolio. The table below shows all assignments that are part of the course. Some are not to be included in the portfolio and some assignments are group assignments (see Table). Assignment Due date Included in portfolio Group assignment Descriptive statistics, reliability and validity, tools for reproducible data science (See Chapter 10) 2021-09-10 Yes Yes Regression models and prediction from data (See Chapter 16) 2021-10-01 No Yes Extraction and analysis of DNA 2021-11-30 Optionala Yes Extraction of RNA and analysis of qPCR experiments 2021-11-30 Optionala Yes Extraction and analysis of Protein 2021-11-30 Optionala Yes Philosophy of scienceb (See canvas) 2021-10-29 Yes No Drawing inference from statistical models and statistical power (See Chapter 21) 2021-11-05 No Yes Study designs (See Chapter 22) 2021-11-12 Yes No Analyzing repeated measures experiments (See Chapter 26) 2021-11-22 Yes No a Select one laboratory assignments for your portfolio exam. All groups presents one selected method on 2021-11-30. b This assignment is presented in connection with lectures. In addition to arbeidskrav/assignments, you are required to contribute to the course wiki. The wiki page is hosted at github.com/dhammarstrom/IDR4000-2021/. In order to contribute you need to set up your own github account. The language of the wiki should be Norwegian. Smaller assignments and quizzes are presented in this book, but you are not required to do them to pass the course. 1.4 Other information "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
