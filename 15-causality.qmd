title: "Associations and causation"
---

We have previously been introduced to a general purpose algorithm for describing associations among variables of choice, the regression model. 


## Association does not imply causation


## Drawing a scientific model using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)





- Chains 
- Forks
- Inverted forks

- Confounding
- Collider bias
- Overcontrol bias 

- Descendants
- Ancestors

- Back-door paths

- Post-treatment variables

## Causality and randomized experiments



```{r}

a <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)

c <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)

b <- a*0.5 + c*0.5 + rnorm(100, 0, 1)


summary(lm(a ~ c + b))


plot(a,c)
plot(b,c)


```
